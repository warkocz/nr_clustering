== README

I've used reductor.py script to remove all metadata from each row leaving only sequence and it's length.
In order to extract sequences from FASTA format I've used Biopython library.

Then I've used bash sort function to sort all rows by length:

$ sort -S1G -t"," -k2nr,2 -T"sort_tmp" -o"nr_sorted" nr_reduced

Then I've cleaned the data (using cleaner.py) removing sequences with not allowed alphabet characters and also removing lengths.

Script: processor.py clusters the sequences into multiple files based on the similarities.
